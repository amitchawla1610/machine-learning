# Predicting energy consumption through machine learning
Check out the Jupyter notebook here: https://jovian.com/amitchawla1610/ml-energy-prediction

This notebook aims to predict a building energy's consumption through 2017 and 2018, using the data from 2016 across 4 different energy categories - electricity, chilled water, steam and hot water.
The data is collected from thousands of buildings across different sites with varied weather conditions. The dataset also features parameters such building attributes, usage patterns to assist in building model.

In this tutorial, we'll follow a step-by-step process for building the ML model:
- Download the dataset
- Exploring the dataset
- Prepare the dataset for training
- Train & Evaluate Different Models
- Tune Hyperparameters
